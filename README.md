# Task 1
The issue was feature envy / inappropriate intimacy. A road object is part of the field for the Froggy object, thus the road object should be in charge of the method of determining if the road is occupied. I wrote a new method in the road class.

# Task 2
The issue was long parameter list in both the Frogger constructor and the addRecord method.
We solved this issue with Frogger ID object, where we pass the id into both the Frogger constructor and addRecord method.
